# Console-Based 2048 Game
ðŸ“‹ Introduction
This is a console-based implementation of the popular 2048 game, developed in C++. The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 1024. The game ends when there are no possible moves left.

ðŸŽ® How to Play
The game is played on a 4x4 grid.
You can use the W, A, S, and D keys to move the tiles up, left, down, and right, respectively.
When two tiles with the same number collide while moving in the same direction, they merge into a tile with a value equal to the sum of their values.
After each move, a new tile with a value of 1 is randomly placed on the grid.
The game ends when there are no possible moves left or when you create a tile with a value of 1024, in which case you win.

W: Move tiles up.
A: Move tiles left.
